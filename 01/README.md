# Flutter App Development Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for students to build a Flutter application following best practices.

---

## 🎨 Figma Design Link
Here is the link to the Figma design that you will use as a reference for this app:  
[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/FvIHWXXIQe3N5mj1tXoNcS/Introduction-Flutter?node-id=0-1&t=IMAMkMrtfyvuy3VJ-1)

## 📦 Remove Default Flutter Code
1. Remove the default code automatically generated by Flutter in the `main.dart` file.
2. Replace it with your own code structure to start fresh and organize the project as per your needs.

---

## 📂 Organize Your Folders
Organize your project using a clear and maintainable folder structure:
- **`pages/`**: Contains the different pages of your app.
- **`widgets/`**: Contains reusable components.
- **`theme/`**: Contains the theme, colors, and styles.

---

## 🏠 Create the `HomePage`
1. Create a main page called **`HomePage`**, which will contain most of the app's logic.
2. Place it in the **`pages`** folder.

---

## 🎨 Configure Colors
1. In the **`theme`** folder, create a file called `app_colors.dart`.
2. Define your app's main colors in this file. Example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class AppColors {
  static const Color primaryColor = Color(0xFF123456);
  static const Color secondaryColor = Color(0xFF654321);
  static const Color accentColor = Color(0xFFABCDEF);
}
```

---

## 🖼️ Add Images
Add your images in the **`pubspec.yaml`** under the `assets` section. Example:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

Create an `assets/images` folder in your project and add your images there.

---

## 🛠️ Structure the `HomePage`
1. In **`HomePage`**, declare a `Scaffold` widget.
2. Add a **`body`** property to the `Scaffold` and place a `Column` inside it, containing all the elements. Example:

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: [
          // Add your widgets here
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Tips: Check the official documentation on [Scaffold](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html) and [Column](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html) for more details.

---

## 🔢 Add the Score
1. In **`HomePage`**, declare a variable for **`score`**. Example:

```dart
int score = 0;
```

2. Display this variable in your UI as shown in the Figma design. Use a **`Text`** widget with a custom style:

```dart
Text(
  "Score : $score",
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
)
```

---

## 👆 Create the `Clicker` Widget
1. In the **`widgets`** folder, create a component called **`Clicker`**.
2. Use the **`Stack`** and **`Align`** widgets to structure your component.
3. Make sure your widget accepts arguments, such as a callback function

---

## 🔘 Integrate the `Bonys` and `Skin` Buttons
1. Create a widget for the buttons in the **`widgets`** folder. You can use:
   - **`ElevatedButton`** for simple buttons.
   - Or use **`Container`** with **`InkWell`** to customize the buttons.

2. In **`HomePage`**, create an **enumeration** to manage the state of your app (for example, displaying the right elements based on the defined value). Example enumeration:

```dart
enum PageState {
  bonuses,
  skins,
}
```

---

## 🃏 Create Effect Cards
1. Create a reusable widget for effect cards in the **`widgets`** folder.

---

## 🚀 Tips for Success
- Refer to the official Flutter documentation if you get stuck on a specific widget.
- Don’t hesitate to ask for help when needed!

Happy coding! 🎉
